                        Hi, my name is Yonderi Diaz. I am a Full-Stack developer
                        with 4 years of experience in the field.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During my career, I have acquired a wide range of skills
                        in backend and frontend technologies such as Node.js,
                        JavaScript, Express, React, React Native, Next.js,
                        Angular, Svelte, Docker, etc...
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also have experience working with a variety of
                        database engines such as SQL Server, MySQL, and MongoDB.
                        I have worked on both individual and team projects and
                        have had the opportunity to develop applications for
                        external clients or companies on a freelance basis.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm a high skilled professional and Iâ€™m always looking
                        for new challenges and opportunities to continue
                        learning and improving my skills.
                    </p>
